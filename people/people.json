"abstract": "Basic graph signal processing (GSP) techniques can be used to transform time series obtained through neuroimaging (be it M/EEG, fMRI, or others) into the graph spectral domain. The necessary basis functions - or "harmonic modes" in network neuroscience - are obtained from functional or structural connectivity matrices that encode network organization in the brain. This procedure involves a number of user-defined parameter choices, namely the type of Laplacian, the number of nearest neighbors in the graph, and the number of dimensions of the reduced space, all of which have an impact on the properties of the harmonic modes. If one applies GSP for the purposes of dimensionality reduction, it is relatively easy to choose these parameters, as one wants to achieve optimal compression. However, it is less clear what properties harmonic modes should have to meaningfully reflect the underlying brain connectivity. Quantitative criteria as to how to set these parameters - or indeed a systematic understanding of how parameter choices impact harmonic modes - are missing thus far, posing a serious limitation for interpreting harmonic modes in terms of their functional significance. In my talk, I will address recent ideas of how to tackle this limitation, looking at embedding and reconstruction performance as well as discussing graph properties that can be derived from the harmonic modes themselves."

"abstract": "The relation between functional activity and the underlying neural architecture in the brain is complex and remains largely unexplored. In this context, graph signal processing (GSP) represents a novel framework allowing to link functional activity signals, e.g., from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and the structural connections underneath (assessed with diffusion MRI) in a non-trivial way. Functional activity patterns are represented as graph signals, defined on top of the structural connectome graph, and graph spectral filtering can be used to distinguish the components of the functional activity that are more or less smooth on the graph; i.e., coupled or decoupled from brain structure, respectively. Here, we investigate and compare structure-function coupling assessed at different temporal scales and with different modalities; i.e., resting-state fMRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In particular, we investigate the capability of structure-function coupling to identify individuals, representing a unique signature of their brains. We conclude that structure-function coupling performs very accurately for individual fingerprinting, with different brain patterns contributing at different time-scales."

"abstract": "The brain is a highly complex system. Disentangling the underlying network structure is crucial to understand the brain functioning under both healthy and pathological conditions. Yet, analyzing brain networks is challenging, in part because their structure represents only one possible realization of a generative stochastic process which is in general unknown. Having a formal way to cope with such intrinsic variability is therefore central for the characterization of brain network properties. Here, we focus on the recent advances of exponential random graph models (ERGMs), as a powerful means to identify the local connection mechanisms behind observed global network structure. Efforts are presented on the quest for basic organizational properties of human brain networks, as well as on the identification of predictive biomarkers of neurological diseases such as stroke. We conclude with a discussion on how emerging results and tools from statistical graph modeling could lead to a finer probabilistic description of complex systems in network neuroscience."

"abstract": "A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to autonomously learn new flexible, cognitive behaviors - that is, behaviors where the appropriate action depends not just on immediate stimuli (as in simple reflexive stimulus-response associations), but on memorized contextual information. Such cognitive, memory-dependent behaviors are by definition meta-learning (``learning to learn'') tasks. Artificial agents can learn a given cognitive task with external, human-designed meta-learning algorithms. By contrast, animals are able to pick up such cognitive tasks automatically, from stimuli and rewards alone, through the operation of their own  internal machinery: evolution has endowed animals with the ability to automatically acquire novel cognitive tasks, including tasks never seen during evolution. Can we harness this process to generate artificial agents with such abilities? Here we evolve neural networks, endowed with plastic connections and neuromodulation, over a sizable set of simple meta-learning tasks based on a framework from computational neuroscience. The resulting evolved networks can automatically modify their own connectivity to acquire a novel simple cognitive task, never seen during evolution, from stimuli and rewards alone, through the spontaneous operation of their evolved neural organization and plasticity system. We suggest that attending to the multiplicity of loops involved in natural learning may provide useful insight into the emergence of intelligent behavior."
